# DEEP LEARNING WITH PYTORCH: A 60 MINUTE BLITZ

https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html

## Setup

We use jupyter notebook as this is an easy way to test new libs. 


### Jupyter Server

in the conda shell `jupyter notebook --notebook-dir F:\dev\projects\pytorchExample`

### Pycharm

Pycharm should detect the notebook when you open the .ipynb file and recommends to install a plugin.

**WARNING: When you open the file in pycharm and in the browser at the same time there can be data loss!**
